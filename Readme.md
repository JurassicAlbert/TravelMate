# TravelMate: Your Personal Travel Assistant

## What are we creating?

TravelMate is an innovative travel assistant application designed to enhance your travel planning experience. It allows users to create personalized travel plans, discover must-visit attractions, restaurants, and hotels, and get answers to location-based queries. Unlike a simple interface for ChatGPT, TravelMate remembers user preferences, favorite places, and past decisions to offer curated recommendations tailored to their unique travel style. Additionally, the app suggests one bonus destination recommended by fellow travelers who have visited the area.
