# TODO List for TravelMate

## Completed Tasks
### Project Initialization
- Established a modular project structure separating backend and frontend components.
- Added `.gitignore` files to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., local configurations, cache) from version control.
- Prepared `Readme.md` with an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

### Backend Development
- Configured the Django backend in `settings.py`, including database connections and middleware.
- Implemented URL routing in `urls.py` for efficient API handling.
- Designed models:
  - **`app_user`**: For managing user profiles and authentication.
  - **`review`**: To allow users to submit and manage reviews of places.
  - **`travel_history`**: To track places visited by users.
  - **`travel_location`**: For storing details about travel locations (name, description, coordinates).
  - **`user_preferences`**: To capture user-specific settings like favorite categories.
- Developed serializers to handle JSON data seamlessly.
- Built RESTful API endpoints with pagination and filtering for improved data accessibility.
- Added initial test data in the `fixtures.json` file.

### Frontend Development
- Configured the Vue.js environment using `package.json` and integrated ESLint for consistent coding standards.
- Designed and implemented `App.vue` as the main entry point for the application.
- Created reusable components:
  - **`HelloWorld`**: A basic test component.
  - **`PlaceCard.vue`**: A component for displaying summarized place details.
- Developed comprehensive views:
  - **`HomePage.vue`**: Displays popular destinations and key features.
  - **`PlaceDetails.vue`**: Provides detailed information about specific locations.
  - **`SearchPlaces.vue`**: Enables users to search and filter places dynamically.
  - **`UserPreferences.vue`**: Allows users to adjust settings and preferences.
  - **`VisitedPlaces.vue`**: Lists places previously visited by the user.
- Configured navigation using Vue Router in `src/router/index.js` to handle user flows effectively.

## Tasks To Be Done
- Add unit tests for critical backend API endpoints to ensure reliability.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Enhance the user interface with polished styling and animations.
- Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure application stability.
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform and configure monitoring tools for performance tracking.
